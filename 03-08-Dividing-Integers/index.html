<p>In this exercise we are going to create integer variables, assign them values, and then learn how to divide them and store the result in another integer variable.</p>
<p>First, initialize an integer variable named num1 and assign it the value 50.</p>
<p>Remember, first we indicate the data type (int), then comes the variable name, then we use the assignment operator (the = sign) and finally provide the value:
<code>int num1 = 50;</code>
Next, initialize another integer variable named num2 and assign it the value 40.</p>
<p>Then, initialize integer variable named  answer to store the quotient of num1 divided by num2.
<code>int answer = 40;</code>
Finally, display the answer variable in the console, using a print statement. </p>
<p>Notice
The exact answer to 50 divided by 40 is 1.25, but since we are storing that number in an integer variable that number gets truncated. When a value is truncated this means that it is not rounded, instead, it is simply stripped of its decimal point and decimal values. This is why our program gives us 1 instead of 1.25.</p>
