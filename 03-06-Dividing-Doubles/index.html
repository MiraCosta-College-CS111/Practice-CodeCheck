<p>In this exercise we are going to create double variables, assign them values, and then learn how to divide them and store the result in another double variable.</p>
<p>First, initialize an double variable named num1 and assign it the value 17.5.</p>
<p>Remember, first we indicate the data type (double), then comes the variable name, then we use the assignment operator (the = sign) and finally provide the value:
<code>double num1 = 17.5;</code>
Next, initialize another double variable named num2 and assign it the value 2.5.</p>
<p>Then, initialize double variable named  answer to store the result of num1 and num2.
<code>double answer = num1 / num2;</code>
Finally, display the answer variable in the console, using a print statement. </p>
