<p>In this exercise we are going to create integer variables, assign them values, and then learn how to multiply them together and store the result in another integer variable.</p>
<p>First, initialize an integer variable named num1 and assign it the value 2.</p>
<p>Remember, first we indicate the data type (int), then comes the variable name, then we use the assignment operator (the = sign) and finally provide the value:
<code>int num1 = 2;</code>
Next, initialize another integer variable named num2 and assign it the value 12.</p>
<p>Then, initialize integer variable named  answer to store the product of num1 and num2.
<code>int answer = num1 * num2;</code>
Finally, display the answer variable in the console, using a print statement. </p>
